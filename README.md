# animated_size_and_fade

This allows you to:

1. Do a **fade and size transition** between two widgets.
2. **Show and hide** a widget, by resizing it vertically while fading.

### Size and Fade

The `AnimatedSizeAndFade` widget does a fade and size transition between a "new" widget and an "old"
widget previously set as a child. The "old" and the "new" children must have the same width, but can
have different heights, and you **don't need to know** their sizes in advance.

You can also define a duration and curve for both the fade and the size, separately.

**Important:** If the "new" child is the same widget type as the "old" child, but with different
parameters, then `AnimatedSizeAndFade` will **NOT** do a transition between them, since as far as
the framework is concerned, they are the same widget, and the existing widget can be updated with
the new parameters. To force the transition to occur, set a `Key` (typically a `ValueKey`
taking any widget data that would change the visual appearance of the widget) on each child widget
that you wish to be considered unique.

Example:

    bool toggle=true;
    Widget widget1 = ...;
    Widget widget2 = ...;
    
    AnimatedSizeAndFade(
       child: toggle ? widget1 : widget2
    );

### Show and Hide

The `AnimatedSizeAndFade.showHide` constructor may be used to show/hide a widget, by resizing it
vertically while fading.

Example:

    bool toggle=true;
    Widget widget = ...;    
    
    AnimatedSizeAndFade.showHide(
       show: toggle,
       child: widget,
    );

## How does it compare to other similar widgets?

- With `AnimatedCrossFade` you must keep both the firstChild and secondChild, which is not necessary
  with `AnimatedSizeAndFade`.

- With `AnimatedSwitcher` you may simply change its child, but then it only animates the fade, not
  the size.

- `AnimatedContainer` also doesn't work unless you know the size of the children in advance.
